This repository contains all the Python programs that I have developed during the course of "Ampliación de Matemáticas 1," during my first year of the MSc in Space Systems.

This repository is divided into different files:

1. **Extra documents**: in this file, there is a report for the *Milestone 2*.
2. **Hito7-main**: this file contains all the programs for my group's *Milestone 7*. This program uses an algorithm to solve chaotic dynamic systems and converts those solutions to music parameters. The "solutions" can be heard, as the program also implements a MIDI converter. The app is called *Chaos-ic*
3. **Milestones 1-6**: this file contains all the milestone's programs. Please enter this file to find detailed information on how the programs for the different milestones work.
4. **Other programs**: this file contains other programs that I have developed during the course, from phase diagrams to a program that displays the lyrics of a song, as well as the guitar chords.
